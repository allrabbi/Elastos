### How is NEO related to Elastos

First of all, a common misconception is that Elastos is built on NEO platform. This is completely false. Elastos has its own blockchain and is NOT a NEP5 token. Elastos already has its main network that went live back in December 2017 at https://blockchain.elastos.org/. Da Hongfei of NEO and Jihan Wu of Bitmain are both early investors and advisors to Elastos. Jihan Wu has committed to redirecting hashing power from Bitcoin mining to Elastos. G3 is a co-operation between NEO, Elastos and Bitmain who share a vision of a decentralized economy and smart web. Key features of the smart web include the virtual machine, runtime environments and trust zone, provided by Elastos and Bitmain, consensus provided by NEO and KYC provided by Ontology. G3 is meant to cooperate with Chinese government regulations and considering two of the leading figures of Chinese blockchain are involved (Jihan Wu and Da Hongfei), the likelihood that these projects will greatly succeed when the Chinese adopt crypto-friendly regulations is very, very high.

### SAIC Motor - China's Largest Auto Manufacturer

A Chinese Leading automaker has signed development collaboration agreement of smart driving with Elastos (SAIC Motor is Tesla's state-owned automobile manufacturing partner in China). The Beijing-based car manufacturer aims to bring in cutting-edge technologies for its models through the partnership which covers vehicular central consoles, electric car control units, high-performance computers and mobile phones.

[Check out a recent research conducted jointly by SAIC Motor and Elastos team to implement Elastos applications in the in-vehicle central control system](https://medium.com/elastos/auto-giants-new-blockchain-game-7e044dbe12b8)

**Summary from the above article**

Recently, Shanghai Automobile Group, the largest automobile manufacturer in China, commissioned the Elastos tech team to implement Elastos applications in the in-vehicle central control system. Through Elastos’ blockchain technology, the user’s identification can be verified and other subsystems in the vehicle will be connected and controlled. Thus, a unified software development platform for smart cars will be built. They hope to solve the issues of the in-vehicle system with the help of Elastos’s cross-platform capability, security features and software development model oriented to component programming.

The entire research project had four parts:

* Vehicle central control panel: Vehicle central control system. TI large screen tablets will be used as the hardware solution and Elastos 5.0 OS will be used as the software solution.
* Automotive controller: The driving simulation control system will include the control of the front wheels, rear wheels, and the brake. Raspberry Pi will be used as the hardware solution and linux+Elastos Runtime SDK will be used as the software solution.
* High-performance computer: It will simulate the driving AI computing platform. In this demo, it’ll mainly be used for real-time recognition and analysis processing based on video streaming. High-performance PC with 1070 graphics cards will be the hardware solution, and Ubuntu+elastos Runtime SDK will be the software solution.
* User’s cellphone: An unused native Android phone that simulates the user’s own mobile phone, communicating and controlling the in-vehicle system through the cellphone app. Software: Android 6.0 + Elastos Runtime SDK

### Huawei visits Elastos Headquarters

On April 3, 2018, from 15:00 to 17:30, Timothy Yuan(Yuan Tingyuan), deputy director of the Central Research Institute of Huwaei Technologies Co., Ltd., has visisted the Shanghai Office of elastos and had an in-depth discussion with Elastos founder Rong Chen.

At the beginning of the communications, Yuan Zhan frankly mentioned the intention of the visit: his admiration for Mr. Chen's many years of experience in the field of operatying systems. He aalso carefully read Elastos whitepaper, and he deeply recognized the ideas discussed in the Whitepaper. The understanding of technology fits well with Huawei's ideas. To this end, he would like to visit Elastos to learn more.

The two sides conducted in-depth discussions on the understanding of the operating system and suggestions on the direction of Huawei's OS technology. At the same time, the two sides also conducted extensive exchanges in the areas of the Internet, blockchain, and digital assets.

During the meeting, Yuan Zong very much agreed with Rong's understanding of the Internet safety: Applications do not need access to the public internet, only encrypted end to end communications. Rong was also convinced by the depth and breadth of this understanding of computers and networks, and expressed his understanding of the technical accumulation of Elastos.

In the end, Yuan Zeng clearly stated that he will continue to communicate with Rong and discuss the potential cooperation space between Huawei and Elastos in terms of technology strategy, community management and operations.
